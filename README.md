JSON EDITOR

This HTML page creates a Dynamic Form Generator that allows users to input a JSON schema, which is then used to generate a form dynamically. Here’s how it works:

Key Features:
JSON Editor:

Users can enter or paste a JSON schema into a text area.
The JSON schema defines the form’s fields (like text inputs, text areas, or dropdowns).
If the schema is invalid, an error message appears.
There is a Copy button to copy the schema to the clipboard.
Form Preview:

The form is generated based on the JSON schema entered by the user.
Each field from the schema appears as an HTML input element in the form.
The form also has a Submit button to collect the data.
Dark Mode:

There is a button to switch between light and dark themes.
Form Submission:

After the form is filled out and submitted, a success message appears, and the option to Download the submission as a JSON file is displayed.
Structure:
JSON Editor: The area where users enter the JSON schema.
Form Preview: The section where the form generated from the JSON is shown.
Toolbar: Contains buttons to toggle dark mode and copy the JSON.
How it works:
Input JSON Schema: When the user enters a JSON schema in the editor, the page validates it and generates the form fields as specified in the schema.
Form Generation: The fields are created based on the schema’s type (text input, text area, or dropdown).
Form Submission: When the user submits the form, the data entered is displayed as a success message, and the option to download the submission as a JSON file becomes available.
Key Buttons:
Copy JSON: Copies the entered JSON schema to the clipboard.
Toggle Dark Mode: Switches between light and dark themes.
Download Submission: Allows the user to download the form submission as a JSON file.
This page makes it easy to generate, customize, and submit forms dynamically based on a JSON input. It also includes additional features like dark mode and form submission download.
